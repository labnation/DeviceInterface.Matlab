% SmartScopePlot - Stops the scope and fetches the full contents 
% of the RAM and plots iot in a graph. 
% Also grabs some timing parameters.
%
% Prerequisites:
% - make sure SmartScopeConnect was executed succesfully first
%
% Usage:
% - just run this script
%
% Good to know:
% - after running this script, type 'scope'
%   to see which parameters are exposed by the scope
% - after running this script, type 'scope.DataSourceScope.LatestDataPackage'
%   to see which parameters are exposed by the most recently acquired
%   datapackage

% first start the scope
scope.Running = true;
scope.CommitSettings();

pause(0.01)

% now stop the scope. This will automatically cause the contents of the RAM
% being loaded into scope.LatestDataPackage
scope.Running = false;
scope.CommitSettings();

% the RAM transfer can take a couple of seconds. wait until the transfer is
% complete
while (scope.DataSourceScope.LatestDataPackage.FullAcquisitionFetchProgress < 1)

 %get the full acquisition
 d = scope.DataSourceScope.LatestDataPackage.GetData(ChannelDataSourceScope.Acquisition, AnalogChannel.ChA);

 %convert .NET array to matlab numbers

 %extract timing data
