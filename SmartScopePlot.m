% SmartScopePlot - Fetches a couple of data sequences from the SmartScope
% and plots them in a graph. Also grabs some timing parameters.
%
% Prerequisites:
% - make sure SmartScopeConnect was executed succesfully first
%
% Usage:
% - just run this script
% - if 5000 frames are too much, hit Ctrl+C
%
% Good to know:
% - after running this script, type 'scope'
%   to see which parameters are exposed by the scope
% - after running this script, type 'scope.DataSourceScope.LatestDataPackage'
%   to see which parameters are exposed by the most recently acquired
%   datapackage
